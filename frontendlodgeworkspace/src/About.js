                        The world has near infinite amount of sights to see. 
                        It's too bad some miss out. At Flathopper, we think 
                        this is wrong and we set out to fix this problem. 
                        Lodging is one aspect that people have to take into 
                        account when traveling, and it could be the most 
                        expensive part of the trip. Hotels can lower their 
                        prices but they have a limit, they have to pay people 
                        salaries, bills and other expenses. One of our founders 
                        was facing this dilemma, so instead of paying for an 
                        expensive hotel when she took a trip to Lisbon, she 
                        looked for alternatives for accommodations. 
                        Luckily, her sibling had made a friend while she was 
                        studying abroad, and the friend lived in Lisbon. 
                        Our co-founder sibling was able to connect her and the 
                        sibling friend, they talked and the roommate charged 
                        her one-third of what the average hotel was charging. 
                        After the trip to Portugal, our co-founder kept wondering 
                        why can't lodging be as cheap as the one she had in Lisbon. 
                        Bing! An idea was born.
